            <p>As an intern, I’m diving into Node.js and Express to build a backend that connects seamlessly with a database. This real-time project involves updating data dynamically, and Express makes it easier with its routing and middleware features. My goal is to create a scalable system that can handle requests efficiently and keep the application up-to-date.</p>

            <p class="original-content">learn WEB Dev</p>
            <p>My internship journey involves mastering the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for web development. This project is about building a full-stack application from scratch—connecting a MongoDB database to a React frontend via Express and Node.js. It’s a hands-on way to understand modern web dev workflows!</p>
